					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>With a rich mix of theatrical material to bring to the table, 
the climate-change debate playing out in the public domain would seem 
well adapted to the stage, and has often been presented in docu-dramatic
 form, as in Al Gore's well-known film
              An Inconvenient Truth
              . But until relatively recently climate change and the 
science relating to it have been conspicuous by their absence from the 
stage. Early movers on the climate-change theatre scene included Caryl 
Churchill's 2006 climate-change libretto for the London Proms,
              We Turned on the Light
              , and John Godber's 2007 play
              Crown Prince
              . Since then, interest has steadily increased. In 2009 
came Steve Waters's double bill
              The Contingency Plan (On the Beach
              and
              Resilience)
              . This was quickly followed by
              Earthquakes in London
              by Mike Bartlett in 2010, and by three further plays in 
the spring of 2011:
              Greenland
              , the collaborative work of Moira Buffini, Matt Charman, 
Penelope Skinner, and Jack Thorne;
              The Heretic
              by Richard Bean; and
              Wastwater
              by Simon Stephens. In this article Julie Hudson focuses on
 three of these works to explore how the plays engage with the debate 
through the medium of climate-change science. As her article suggests, 
these British climate-change plays make an important and occasionally 
subversive contribution to the long-running discourse on the 
relationship between science, the ecosystem, and human beings. In 
performance, they succeed in turning a subject that has been overplayed 
for effect in the public domain into compelling theatre. Julie Hudson is
 currently a visiting fellow at the Smith School of Enterprise and the 
Environment, Oxford University.</td>

						<td>This paper argues that young people need to be given the 
opportunity to recognise the interaction between their own 
understandings of the world as it is now and the vision of what it might
 become. To support this argument, we discuss an urban planning project,
 known as the Lower Mill Site Project, which involved active 
participation of high school students from the local community. The 
outcomes of this project demonstrate the positive contributions young 
people can make to the process of urban redevelopment, the advantages of
 using a participatory design approach, and the utopian possibilities 
that can emerge when young people are invited to be part of an 
intergenerational community project.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Adaptation has emerged as an important area of research and 
assessment among climate change scientists. Most scholarly work has 
identiﬁed resource constraints as being the most signiﬁcant determinants
 of adaptation. However, empirical research on adaptation has so far 
mostly not addressed the importance of measurable and alterable 
psychological factors in determining adaptation. Drawing from the 
literature in psychology and behavioural economics, we develop a 
socio-cognitive Model of Private Proactive Adaptation to Climate Change 
(MPPACC). MPPACC separates out the psychological steps to taking action 
in response to perception, and allows one to see where the most 
important bottlenecks occur—including risk perception and perceived 
adaptive capacity, a factor largely neglected in previous climate change
 research. We then examine two case studies—one from urban Germany and 
one from rural Zimbabwe—to explore the validity of MPPACC to explaining 
adaptation. In the German study, we ﬁnd that MPPACC provides better 
statistical power than traditional socio-economic models. In the 
Zimbabwean case study, we ﬁnd a qualitative match between MPPACC and 
adaptive behaviour. Finally, we discuss the important implications of 
our ﬁndings both on vulnerability and adaptation assessments, and on 
efforts to promote adaptation through outside intervention.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper is an heuristic application in understanding 
China’s alternative futures by looking at the deeper patterns of history
 and social change developed by four macrohistorians: Sima Qian, Prabhat
 Ranjan Sarkar, Pitirim Sorokin and Oswald Spengler. It questions the 
dominant perspective on the future that the Western liberal and 
consumerist system will endlessly rise. By using macrohistorical 
perspectives, distance is created from short-term economic and political
 projections allowing a view of the stages of history, the broader shape
 of the future through space and time, which provides another way to 
think about China’s alternative futures. Four alternative futures are 
developed. In the ﬁrst future, there is a regime change, with moves 
towards democracy and greater human rights. In the second future, there 
is a Golden Age for China and the world with major scientiﬁc, political 
and cultural achievements. In the third future, change is material and 
shallow, and in the fourth future there is collapse, not just of China’s
 rise, but also of the world capitalist system.</td>

						<td>Increasing attention is being paid to behavioural economics in
 the social sciences and in public policy. We attempt to gather up the 
effects based on previous reviews of the literature and show the 
implications for transport and energy consumption. We show that there 
are several behavioural aspects of incentives on individual behaviour. 
We also show that there are a number of contextual factors on individual
 behaviour, such as messengers, norms, defaults, salience, priming, 
affect, commitment, and ego. We show the implications of this research 
for experimentation, and the measurement of wellbeing. In particular, we
 argue that transport research should use ﬁeld experiments to carefully 
demonstrate causality in the evaluation of interventions.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper investigates the contribution of socio-economic 
scenarios to improve decisions and policies in climate assessments. We 
speciﬁcally looked at adaptation projects in the Dutch Climate changes 
Spatial Planning programme. Based on the four decision failure criteria 
neglect of internal information, bounded rationality, insufﬁcient 
expansion of existing mental models and stickiness and lack of friction 
of information and knowledge, it was concluded that in these projects, 
socio-economic scenarios appear to generate useful data, but that their 
full potential to reduce decision failure is not likely to be exploited.
 Therefore adaptation options suggested by these studies may not be 
‘future-proof’: they may be appropriate in some future societies, but 
fail in others. We believe similar results would be obtained in other 
contexts. Possible decision failures are caused by neglecting 
socio-economic developments, limiting the number of storylines generated
 by scenario studies to one or two, lack of stakeholder involvement in 
the scenario development and ignoring discontinuities.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Whilst past research has explored the notion of co-evolution 
and ambidexterity in organizations, few have drawn from theoretical 
insights made in other domains of study such as biology and cultural 
evolution. This paper seeks to make a contribution towards this project,
 by developing an agent-based simulation model of multi-level 
co-evolution within an organization, with a view towards shedding new 
light on organizational adaptation. Unlike previous simulation studies 
of this nature, this study focuses on the coevolution of behaviour at 
multiple-levels between interacting individuals, based on the 
evolutionary mechanisms of variation, selection and retention. In this 
way it is seen that incremental, punctuated and chaotic patterns of 
aggregate organizational behaviour arise from the same core building 
blocks of variation–selection–retention. The ﬁndings from this study 
point to the need for management control in ambidextrous organizations 
both during times of stability AND transformational change. In the 
latter case, this control was not that of an overpowering management 
suppressing variations and innovation from within the organization. 
Rather it might be interpreted as the voice of calm in the chaos of the 
storm, providing direction to the many actors within the organization 
and walking them along the thin line between inaction and chaos.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Stories, dreams, histories and myths, Michel de Certeau 
argues, connect people to particular places and makes place concrete and
 inhabitable. These narratives generate an imaginary, poetic geography 
that haunts the abstract city of street maps and development plans, and 
makes it socially meaningful. This paper is concerned with one 
particular kind of story-telling – science ﬁction – and its relationship
 with the city, urban planning, and questions of community engagement. 
The paper argues that the ‘cities of the imagination’ generated by 
science ﬁction and other forms of narrative provide a powerful means of 
understanding, communicating and enriching the connections to place in 
urban communities. Moreover, science ﬁction is often characterised by 
its ability to explore the future of cities. This gives the genre a 
fascinating and potentially useful resonance with urban planning as a 
discourse and set of practices; and, in particular, strategies for 
engaging communities in the design process and, thus, designing for 
future social sustainability. These ideas will be tested through a 
reading of near-future urban spatiality in the cyberpunk stories of 
William Gibson. The theorisation of the relationship between urban space
 and narrative in the work of de Certeau and other theorists will be 
used to help frame this discussion.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This review article surveys the complex terrain of the 
imagination as a way of understanding and exploring the manifestations 
of anthropogenic climate change in culture and society. Imagination here
 is understood as a way of seeing, sensing, thinking, and dreaming that 
creates the conditions for material interventions in, and political 
sensibilities of the world. It draws upon literary, filmic, and creative
 arts practices to argue that imaginative practices from the arts and 
humanities play a critical role in thinking through our representations 
of environmental change and offer strategies for developing diverse 
forms of environmental understanding from scenario building to 
metaphorical, ethical, and material investigations. The interplay 
between scientific practices and imaginative forms is also addressed. 
Thematically, this review addresses the modalities of climate futures, 
adaptive strategies, and practices of climate science in its study of 
key imaginative framings of climate change. WIREs Clim Change 2011 2

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Recently the importance of addressing values in discussions of
 risk perception and adaptation to climate change has become manifest. 
Values-based approaches to climate change adaptation and the cultural 
cognition thesis both illustrate this trend. We argue that in the wake 
of this development it is necessary to take the dynamic relationship 
between values and beliefs seriously, to acknowledge the possibility of 
bi-directional relationships between values and beliefs, and to address 
the variety of values involved (e.g. personal, epistemic and cultural 
values). The dynamic relationship between values and beliefs, we claim, 
highlights the need to bring ethical considerations to bear on climate 
change communication. In particular, we must ask whether it is 
acceptable to tailor information about the risks of climate change in an
 effort to maximize communicative effectiveness given the values of the 
target group.</td>

						<td>A survey investigated risk judgements related to climate 
change. In order to understand which the important determinants of such 
risk judgements are, demographic factors and knowledge were assessed in a
 questionnaire answered by 621 Swedish residents. Demographic factors 
included gender, parenthood, type and level of education, age, and level
 of urbanization of the place of residence, while knowledge covered 
knowledge of state, causes, and consequences of climate change. 
Regression analyses showed that both cognitive risk judgements (of 
probability) of serious negative consequences and affective risk 
judgements (worry) were predicted by knowledge of causes and knowledge 
of consequences of climate change, in particular health consequences. 
Women were more worried than men but did not differ from men with 
respect to the cognitive risk judgements.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In July 2012, Russ George, the founder of Planktos Inc., 
organized efforts to dump 100 tons of iron sulfate off the coast of 
Canada to engineer a plankton bloom that would, ostensibly, absorb 
carbon dioxide and store it in the depths of the Paciﬁc Ocean. As 
George’s geoengineering experiment is one of the largest and ﬁrst of its
 kind, many were quick to denounce his rogue action while others were 
delighted to see that he succeeded as a large algae bloom was reported 
to have emerged. Using the George event as a point of entry for 
exploring alternative futures of geoengineering in an age of global 
weirding, this project fuses the 2 Â 2 scenario modeling technique with 
the ‘‘Ma¯ noa School’’ four-futures method by situating command and 
control, along X (control) and Y (command) axes as two critical 
uncertainties and key drivers of change that will impact the design, 
development, and diffusion of climate mitigation engineering 
initiatives, which some see as holding the only solution to avert global
 catastrophe and others condemn as a postnormal remedy. ß 2013 Elsevier

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In this study, evolutionary theory is used to analyze and 
critique the strategic process of scenario planning. We argue that 
scenario planning can be strengthened as a theory- and practice-oriented
 process through the incorporation of evolutionary theory in the 
scenario narrative process, and in the subsequent implementation phases 
in response to environmental change. First, this paper addresses 
scenario planning in relation to theoretical perspectives on strategic 
planning and forecasting. Then, the concepts of variation, selection, 
retention, organizational learning and inertia are used to analyze 
scenario planning as a strategic process. This study argues that because
 scenario planning mirrors modes of variation and selection at the 
organizational level, evolutionary theory is a useful approach for 
assessing the plausibility of scenario narratives and strengthening the 
theoretical foundation of scenario planning as a process. By utilizing 
an evolutionary framework throughout the scenario planning process, this
 method has a better chance of encouraging exploratory strategic 
thinking without reinforcing non-blind variation or inertial practices. 
Concepts including inertia can also be used to better address bias and 
myopia in the scenario planning process. Additionally, evolutionary 
theory can be used to assess how entities learn from the outcomes of 
scenario planning as the environment changes over time.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article focuses on the project Storytelling for Peace, 
Gender Partnership and Cultural Pluralism, initiated in 2009 in Novi 
Sad, Serbia, with the primary aim of promoting educational strategies 
which challenge the continuation of the dominator society’s status quo 
and facilitate the emergence of alternative, progressive and socially 
inclusive futures. Constructive storytelling was chosen as an 
educational practice that can bring about change, and was used as a tool
 for the transfer of alternative worldviews because it is indirect, 
ﬂexible and inexpensive. The main beneﬁciaries of the project were the 
students of the University of Novi Sad and teachers and children of Novi
 Sad primary schools. The project utilised local knowledge and languages
 to foster peace and partnership-oriented individual and social 
narratives through the process of alternative story writing and revision
 of traditional Serbian and European tales. The participants learned to 
deconstruct master narratives, to understand deep culture and how its 
underlying myths shape national identity. Alternative stories became a 
tool to teach critical thinking and promote a diversity of voices.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper critically assesses a series of scenario planning 
exercises in the Washington Metropolitan region and the State of 
Maryland within a broad and evolving framework of participatory 
planning. Reality Check, as the exercises were called, were a daylong 
set of activities using tools that encouraged stakeholder participation 
to develop scenarios focused on long-term regional sustainability. The 
paper draws upon planning theory, participant reactions, media reports, 
post-exercise outcomes and author’s experiences of shaping the process. 
It illustrates how the model was adapted to multiple scales and 
contexts, and variations in desired technical complexity. The paper 
concludes that such processes have an inherent value in capturing the 
issues of the future and in creating awareness and knowledge. It argues 
that certain considerations such as early strategic engagement of 
stakeholders, ﬂexibility of technical tools and diversity among 
organizers, all played a role in enhancing the dialogue. Furthermore, it
 suggests that when timed with favorable external conditions and 
designed within suitable institutional frameworks, they have the 
potential to provide a foundation from which tangible regional beneﬁts 
can be realized.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>National climate change policy currently operates on a 
continuum from the local community to the supra-national level. These 
initiatives include local deliberative processes of low-carbon futures 
as well as local-global interactions in ‘eco-innovation jam’ dialogues 
carried out in a virtual space, but founded on communicating with local 
stakeholder groups. Experiences from national processes and 
international examples of these structured dialogues of community 
engagement raise important questions of environmental justice and 
deliberative processes that facilitate participation by some groups, but
 perhaps also neglect others. This is particularly relevant since the 
environmental justice discourse traditionally frames environmental 
concerns in a place-bound manner that includes local responses to 
environmental questions. In this paper we argue the importance of local 
and global forums and deliberative processes for community engagement in
 order to incorporate stakeholders’ perceptions of future options for 
low-carbon living, travelling and consuming services and products. 
Important policy transformations in planning for low-carbon societies 
are outlined and results from cases are discussed. We conclude with 
three remarks about the importance of citizen participation for 
understanding local conditions for change, processes of localized 
internationalization, and new roles for nation states facing the climate
 change challenge. We also recognise the importance of the local and 
global level of deliberative processes targeting sustainable urban 
futures.</td>

						<td>Studies of ‘futures’ have hitherto focused on those that are 
predictable and ‘tame’, and on those that are unpredictable and ‘wild’. 
Here we consider a new class, the ‘feral’; which are expectations that 
things might be made worse by risk-based actions. The type case is the 
nuclear accident at Three Mile Island, where operatives assumed that 
what was unfolding was of a sort described in their manual, and 
discovered too late that responses based on that assumption were making 
the situation worse. In this paper we review the idea of ‘feral’ and how
 it applies to futures, and discuss the different modes of engagement 
(or non-engagement) with feral futures. To make feral futures 
manageable, we suggest two ideas from other spheres of activity. Zen is a
 practice and philosophy which enables us to drop our preconceptions and
 thereby to respond to emerging, unprecedented situations. Aesthetics 
articulates a particular way to sense and appreciate realities 
intuitively, again enabling a direct response. The combination of Zen 
and aesthetics with scenario practice in the tradition of Pierre Wack 
provides a promising mode of response to emerging feral futures.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Geospatial maps are here used for interpreting of what a 
scenario with a warming Arctic with less ice will mean for activity 
structures of the globe in the future. This will enable certain 
locations in the High North to become important activity areas. Of most 
consequence are the fundamental activity structures of Earth, like 
global shipping, world trade and oil extraction. These will be impacted 
as the Arctic sea routes have opened, opening up shorter shipping 
distances between the N-Paciﬁc and N-Atlantic Oceans. The reduction of 
ice in the Arctic Ocean will also lead to ever improved access to the 
resources of Arctic ocean-ﬂoor and the Arctic Region—perhaps most 
importantly to oil and gas.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>There is an urgent need for meaningful information and 
effective public processes at the local level to build awareness, 
capacity, and agency on climate change, and support planning and 
decision-making. This paper describes a conceptual framework to meet 
these requirements by generating alternative, coherent, holistic climate
 change scenarios and visualizations at the local scale, in 
collaboration with local stakeholders and scientists. The framework 
provides a template for a process to integrate emission scenarios with 
both mitigation and adaptation strategies, and to link local 
manifestations of impacts and responses with global climate change 
scenarios. The article outlines the empirical application of this 
framework in the Local Climate Change Visioning Project in British 
Columbia, Canada. The project collaboratively localized, spatialized, 
and visualized possible climate change effects and community responses 
in the community’s ‘backyards’. The article concludes with lessons 
learned and suggested principles for future visioning efforts to engage 
communities in possible policy and behavioural choices.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The diagnostic of the Anthropocene proposes a new geological 
epoch that designates humans as beings capable of geomorphic force, 
shaping Earth systems on a par with inhuman forces. This social geology 
marks an ascendance to inhuman planetary power fuelled by fossil fuels 
from the Carboniferous. Yet nowhere are the geophysical, genomic, and 
social narratives of this geologic subjectification considered together 
to interrogate these geologic capacities, not just in terms of impacts 
on the Earth, but as forces that subjects share—geologic forces that 
compose and differentiate corporeal and collective biopolitical 
formations. I argue in this paper that the concept of the Anthropocene 
is axiomatic of new understandings of time, matter, and agency for the 
human as a collective being and as a subject capable of geomorphic acts;
 a being that not just affects geology, but is an intemperate force 
within it. This immersion of humanity into geologic time suggests both a
 remineralisation of the origins of the human and a shift in the human 
timescale from biological life course to that of epoch and species–life.
 The paper is structured as a modest conversation between two fossilised
 subjects that define the imagined origin and ending of the narrative 
arc of the Anthropocene—one from the prehistory of human origins, the 
other from the future of the Anthropocene—in a conversation about time, 
geology, and inhuman becomings. Examining fossils as material and 
discursive knots in the narrative arc of human becoming, I argue for a 
‘geological turn’ that takes seriously not just our biological (or 
biopolitical) life, but also our geological (or geopolitical) life and 
its forms of differentiation. Fossils unlock this life–death, 
time–untimely, corporeal–incorporeal equation, suggesting the need for a
 theory of the geologic and a reckoning with the forces of mute matter 
in lively bodies: a corporeality that is driven by inhuman forces. This 
paper investigates what I am calling “geologic life”—a mineralogical 
dimension of human composition that remains currently undertheorised in 
social thought and is directly relevant for the material, temporal, and 
corporeal conceptualisation of fossil fuels. This geologic life prompts a
 need to rethink the coherency of the human as a territorialising force 
of the Earth in its prehistoric, contemporary, and future-orientated 
incarnation. As such, this paper proposes a speculative theoretical 
framework for thinking modes of geologic life within the Anthropocene.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The use of a constant discount rate to study long-lived 
environmental problems such as global warming has two disadvantages: the
 prescribed policy is sensitive to the discount rate, and with moderate 
discount rates, large future damages have almost no effect on current 
decisions. Timeconsistent quasi-hyperbolic discounting alleviates both 
of these modeling problems, and is a plausible description of how people
 think about the future. We analyze the time-consistent Markov Perfect 
equilibrium in a general model with a stock pollutant. The solution to 
the linear-quadratic specialization illustrates the role of hyperbolic 
discounting in a model of global warming.</td>

						<td>In 2006, Adam J. Berinsky and Donald R. Kinder published 
ﬁndings in the Journal of Politics that demonstrated that framing news 
as a story inﬂuences how individuals cognitively organize concepts and 
information. The study presented here moves forward in this tradition. 
This research combines samples obtained in the springs of 2009 and 2010 
while conducting online experiments. In these experiments, slightly over
 2,000 respondents are asked to organize concepts presented in one of 
three culturally nuanced stories about climate change or where 
information is presented as a list. Hierarchical cluster analysis 
indicates that when respondents are exposed to culturally congruent 
stories, respondent organizational patterns are more likely to mirror 
the story. We discuss the implications of these ﬁndings.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In 2006, Adam J. Berinsky and Donald R. Kinder published 
ﬁndings in the Journal of Politics that demonstrated that framing news 
as a story inﬂuences how individuals cognitively organize concepts and 
information. The study presented here moves forward in this tradition. 
This research combines samples obtained in the springs of 2009 and 2010 
while conducting online experiments. In these experiments, slightly over
 2,000 respondents are asked to organize concepts presented in one of 
three culturally nuanced stories about climate change or where 
information is presented as a list. Hierarchical cluster analysis 
indicates that when respondents are exposed to culturally congruent 
stories, respondent organizational patterns are more likely to mirror 
the story. We discuss the implications of these ﬁndings.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Economists define risk in terms of variability of possible 
outcomes whereas clinicians and laypeople generally view risk as 
exposure to possible loss or harm. Neuroeconomic studies using 
relatively simple behavioral tasks have identified a network of brain 
regions that respond to economic risk, but these studies have had 
limited success predicting naturalistic risk-taking. In contrast, more 
complex behavioral tasks developed by clinicians (e.g., Balloon Analogue
 Risk Task and Iowa Gambling Task) correlate with naturalistic 
risk-taking but resist decomposition into distinct cognitive constructs.
 We propose that to bridge this gap and better understand neural 
substrates of naturalistic risk-taking, new tasks are needed that: (1) 
are decomposable into basic cognitive/economic constructs; (2) predict 
naturalistic risk-taking; and (3) engender dynamic, affective 
engagement.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>As a result of signing the Kyoto Agreement the UK will need to
 reduce carbon emissions to 20% of their 1990 value by 2050. This will 
require a complete change in power generation over the next 40 years. 
The system involved is immensely complex, with multiple agents, levels 
of description, new technologies and new policies and actions. However, 
here we develop a relatively simple spatial, dynamic model representing a
 basic part of the problem – the changing geographical distribution of 
electrical generation capacity in the UK. It runs from 2010 until 2050 
and allows the exploration of the different pattern of investments in, 
and closures of, generation capacity. It was develop as part of the 
CASCADE project on Smart Grids to provide scenarios for annual changes 
in generating capacity. It provides generation scenarios for much more 
complex, multi-agent models, such as that developed in the CASCADE 
project, that represent the short-term (30 min time step) dynamics of 
the wholesale and retail energy markets. The model allows us to explore 
different possible pathways to 2050 and the difﬁculty of the overall 
endeavour. In order to increase electricity production but reduce CO2 
emissions, we shall need to close our current coal/gas generating plants
 and make a vast investment in new low carbon generating capacity. The 
model allows us to rapidly the possible consequences of innovations in 
technologies, and to re-shape plans in the light of as new opportunities
 and circumstances.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The actions of individuals are recognised as crucial in 
reducing energy demand and shifting people towards sustainable energy 
sources. Much of the work that has occurred within environmental 
psychology has been built upon a social cognitive paradigm, which 
attempts to explain the drives, forces and processes that explain and 
determine individual behaviour. Despite the volume of this work, the 
promotion of pro-environmental behaviour has not achieved broad 
transformations in energy conservation behaviours. Recently, researchers
 working in the ﬁeld of pro-environmental research have started to draw 
on narrative in their work as a framework to (re) integrate individuals 
into their historical, social and cultural settings. However, this work,
 when applied to energy conservation, remains in its infancy. This paper
 adds to the growing literature that is increasingly asserting the key 
role for narrative in the ﬁeld of pro-environmental psychology research.
 The paper articulates the foundations of the narrative turn from its 
development within literary theory to its adoption by the social 
sciences, with particular reference to psychological theory. This paper 
provides a review of the ways in which taking a narrative perspective 
can oﬀer rich insights into complex phenomena, as well as potential ways
 to reconceptualise ways forward for energy research.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>It can be argued that the main thinking in transport planning 
and policy making stem from neoclassical economics in which individuals 
are largely assumed to make rational, consistent, and efﬁcient choices, 
and apply cognitive processes of decision making that maximise their 
economic utility. Research in behavioural sciences indicates that 
individuals’ choices in a wide range of contexts deviate from the 
predictions of the rational man paradigm inspired the research agenda in
 the ﬁeld of travel behaviour. New concepts and practices of government 
aim to apply some behavioural economics insights in the design of 
behavioural change initiatives and measures, an approach recently 
advocated in the US and the UK. This paper provides a brief review on 
the use and potential of behavioural economics from the perspective of 
transport and climate change, in two main contexts: travel demand 
modelling and design of behaviour change measures. The discussion of 
limitations and knowledge gaps associated with the implementation of 
behavioural economics to a travel behaviour context might contribute to 
the debate and help in deﬁning research agenda in this area.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Insofar as the viability of industrial society is at stake, 
energy supply and climate change are not normal scientiﬁc issues. Fossil
 fuel is the ultimate ﬁnite resource, and the atmosphere the ultimate 
ﬁnite sink. There is dispute about the most fundamental issues and 
values to be promoted or defended. The concept of post-normal science 
has been introduced for precisely this kind of situation, where ‘‘facts 
are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent 
(Ravetz [1, p. 349]).’’ Although this applies equally to energy supply 
and climate change, the related knowledge regimes offer a remarkable 
contrast. Mainstream energy science, on the one hand, has refused to 
engage in post-normal science. The accredited experts at the 
International Energy Agency (IEA) and elsewhere have left ‘‘peak 
energy’’ to mavericks at the fringes or outside mainstream scientiﬁc 
discourse. Consequently, the pressing issue of future energy scarcity 
has been kept from the public agenda. Ofﬁcial climate science, on the 
other hand, has embraced post-normal science. But even though the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been uniquely 
successful in placing climate change on the public agenda, the inherent 
ambiguities of post-normal science have plunged climate science into a 
deep legitimacy crisis. Most people prefer denial and self-deception to 
an unvarnished vision of the truth when intractable problems such as 
peak energy and climate change are at stake. In such cases, scientists 
are in a double bind: they are damned if they do and doomed if they do 
not engage in post-normal science.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Historical commercial districts in city centres in Turkey face
 social, cultural, environmental and economical challenges of managing 
rapid urban and economical development in the last two decades. They are
 being subjected to dramatic physical deterioration and rapid social and
 economical decline. Enriching relationships between local tradesmen 
associations, local authorities and non-governmental organisations 
through a structured engagement process can deliver innovative new 
revitalisation approaches and design options towards sustainable futures
 of historical commercial districts both in Turkey and in the world. 
This paper presents a community engagement model, which can be seen as 
the revival of a guild system (Lonca), which is unique to Ottoman 
Turkish culture, for the sustainable future of a historical commercial 
district in a Turkish city, Bursa. One of the main objectives of this 
study is to discuss and evaluate successes and failures of this 
community engagement model. Other objective of the paper is to discuss 
the effectiveness of this civil organisation for creating scenarios 
about sustainable future of a historical commercial district. The key 
ﬁnding of this study shows community engagement models should support 
public decision making by developing a coherent framework to identify 
the sustainable future scenarios with multi- or interdisciplinary 
collaborations.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Social marketing is the systematic application of marketing 
concepts and techniques to achieve speciﬁc behavioural goals relevant to
 the social good. Social marketing approaches are becoming increasingly 
popular among governmental and non-governmental actors seeking to engage
 the public on climate change. The effectiveness of social marketing in 
achieving speciﬁc behavioural goals is empirically wellsupported. 
However, in the ﬁrst systematic critique of social marketing as a 
strategy for engaging the public on climate change, we present evidence 
that social marketing alone is insufﬁcient to build support for the more
 ambitious policy changes and interventions that constitute a 
proportional response to climate change. In some circumstances, social 
marketing approaches may even be counterproductive. We describe some 
alternative approaches for engaging the public, which may provide 
governmental and non-governmental actors with additional or preferable 
tools for promoting public engagement with climate change. Given the 
scale of the challenge, it seems critical that those seeking to engage 
the public are equipped with the most effective strategies available – a
 goal that this paper seeks to contribute to. We conclude that 
acknowledging the limitations of social marketing – and exploring 
alternative methods of engaging the public – is an urgent task for 
climate change communication researchers and practitioners.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Climate change has been described by Morton (2013) as a 
‘hyperobject,’ meaning that its existence is too large for humans to 
perceive entirely. Climate change policy has been criticized as being 
bloodless and unimaginative (Watts, 2015), whereas stories have been 
used to understand climate change through lived experience (Rice et al, 
2015). How can storytelling bring climate change policy into focus? 
Storytelling makes the symbolic visceral, creating a material 
experience. In many ways, stories connect the ‘out there’ to the here 
and now, while at the same time inspiring the critical capacity 
necessary to imagine a then and there, a task critical to policymakers. 
Using the concept of a geologic imagination as a conceptual springboard,
 this piece will explore the ways in which storytelling can help climate
 policy articulate climate change as a visceral, material experience. 
Though storytelling has been used to understand the day-to-day 
experience of climate change in peoples’ lives, this paper speciﬁcally 
aims to theorize the ways in which storytelling can be useful for 
connecting those experiences to the longer story of climate change and 
how these connections can enhance policy.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Any sociological discussion of energy consumption must 
necessarily deal with not only the social practices underpinning that 
consumption, but also the complex sociotechnical assemblages through 
which such consumption is enabled. Likewise any sociological discussion 
of climate change must necessarily deal with not only radically diﬀerent
 contexts, but also the inherent uncertainty that accompanies any 
exploration of times yet to come. There are many ways in which one might
 narrate and/or critique such futures, but few which can handle all of 
the challenges mentioned above. Such work requires a medium and 
methodology which can: represent the social alongside the technological;
 move ﬂuidly between micro, meso and macro scales; reconcile historical 
trajectories with extrapolated trends and speculative leaps; and – 
perhaps most importantly—speak across (and beyond) the disciplinary and 
administrative silos of both the state and the academy. This paper makes
 a case for the utility of prose science ﬁction both as a methodological
 tool of representation and portrayal for energy futures research which 
meets these criteria, and as a storehouse of tools and strategies for 
the critique of energy futures.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article presents the interconnected phases of a 
regional-foresight process in an AR perspective within the context of a 
complex regional dynamic of actors with distinct local and regional 
political presences. The analysis is based on a Norwegian case of AR on 
regional foresight. The article reﬂects upon and develops the concept of
 action research (AR) as it relates to regional-foresight practices in 
connection with regional planning strategies (policies), according to 
Norway’s new Planning and Building Act (PBA, 2008). Both AR and regional
 foresight are broad terms within a number of domains, and several 
contributions have sought to show how these are interlinked Ramos 
(2006). The focus is on how AR and action researchers both contribute to
 the co-creation of regional and subregional formulation of planning by 
regional-foresight processes, which are driven by decision-making 
regional bodies. This article contributes to the understanding of how an
 AR strategy of ‘strategic facilitation’ may improve the overall 
foresight capacity of all regional actors, both in concert and as single
 stakeholders. Also it furthers the understanding of how an AR approach 
may assist in transforming the foresight practices and the strategic 
decision-making into a more transparent process.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper examines the idea of an online collaborative 
competition for solutions to environmental and social problems. It asks 
three basic questions: What is a collaborative competition? In what 
sense are collaborative competitions collaborative? And in view of the 
social and environmental goals of the competitions, are they a 
contribution to sustainability practice? Prepared by a conceptual 
analysis, partly drawing on the arguments for extended peer review in 
post-normal science, and based on the in-depth analysis of one 
collaborative competition, it is argued that the idea of a collaborative
 competition is innovative and suggestive; however, in practice there is
 only weak evidence for collaboration – the competitive element clearly 
prevails. The innovation, in practice, is a new way of making visible 
and thereby promoting social and environmental ideas. There is some 
evidence for collaborative spirit, but there is only limited evidence 
that arguments for extended peer review apply. The design of the online 
collaborative competition might not promote collaboration as well as it 
could. Therefore, the paper ends with a discussion of possibilities for 
changing the design of the competition.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In Bourdieu’s sociological classic Distinction, he theorized 
tastes of necessity (in contrast to tastes of luxury) as an habitualized
 working-class propensity toward consumption practices deduced from 
constrained economic conditions. These practices also had the capacity 
to self-perpetuate in the absence of their conditions of generation. 
This taste/practice may also be called frugality. I encountered this 
phenomenon in a qualitative analysis of N = 28 interviews with aﬄuent 
climate change activists in the Washington, DC, area. Though frugality 
was only practiced by a minority of research participants, it was 
generally scripted as a motivational component in their climate change 
activism and imbued with deep meaning and narrative detail. Respondents 
also referred to an intertwined range of logics of frugality: forced, 
thrifty, waste-not, environmental, cheap, oppositional and more…. This 
analysis expands Bourdieu’s insights. There is evidence of an embodied 
and intergenerational frugality: a frugal habitus/disposition—an echo of
 once constrained economic conditions. Though frugality may be a 
practice of some aﬄuent climate change activists, its capacity to reduce
 human impacts on the environment is questionable and deserves more 
attention. I also call for a greater acknowledgement and aﬃrmation of 
frugality and its practitioners.</td>

						<td>Background: Changing teamwork climate in healthcare through a 
collective shift in attitudes and values may be a necessary precursor to
 establishing a positive teamwork culture, where innovations can be more
 readily embedded and sustained. A complex educational intervention was 
initiated across an entire UK Trust’s surgical provision, and then 
sustained. Attitudes towards teamwork were measured longitudinally to 
examine if the intervention produced sustainable results. Aims: The 
research aimed to test whether sustaining a complex education 
intervention to improve teamwork would result in an incremental, 
longitudinal improvement in attitudes and values towards teamwork. The 
intervention’s larger aim is to progress the historical default position
 of multi-professional work to authentic inter-professional teamwork, as
 a positive values climate translates in time into behavioural change 
defining a safety culture.
Method: Attitudes were measured at three points across all surgical team
 personnel over a period of 4 years, using a validated Safety Attitudes 
Questionnaire with a focus on the ‘teamwork climate’ domain. Pre- and 
post-intervention ‘teamwork climate’ scores were compared to give a 
longitudinal measure as a test of sustainability.
Results: Mean ‘teamwork climate’ scores improved incrementally and 
significantly following the series of educational interventions, showing
 that practitioners’ valuing of teamwork activity can be improved and 
sustained.
Conclusions: Longitudinal positive change in attitudes and values 
towards teamwork can be sustained, suggesting that a deliberate, 
designed complex intervention can shape a safety climate as a necessary 
prerequisite for the establishment of a sustainable safety culture.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Rather than appealing to the agency of community and the 
received discourse of sustainability, this paper offers a critical 
perspective on both concepts. It puts forward a contextually dynamic 
view of urban futures – presented at a moment when the continuity of 
human settlement in its current forms appears as increasingly 
problematic. Against this backdrop, both community and urban futures are
 rethought and brought into relation with (i) the emergent discourse of 
‘sustainment’ (named as a moment, project and process) and (ii) the rise
 of ‘redirective practice’. Overall, the argument and ideas presented 
seek to reframe how the fate of the city, its social fabric, economy and
 political structures are viewed and engaged.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Climate Outreach works at the interface of research and 
practice. This paper explains how Climate Outreach have used a Narrative
 Workshop methodology to test and develop narratives around energy 
transitions and climate policy with a diverse range of UK citizens. The 
paper begins by providing the rationale for a more participatory 
politics of climate change, and why narratives are central to that 
political process. This is followed with an outline of recent forms of 
participatory climate change initiatives within the UK. The next section
 presents a more detailed account of the methodology through an analysis
 of two recent research projects where the Narrative Workshop 
methodology has been used. The ﬁrst case study uses examples from a 
number of workshops held with centre-right public audiences to 
demonstrate how the methodology has been applied to identify climate 
change narratives and vocabulary which reﬂect conservative values. The 
second case study illustrates how the methodology was used to create a 
template for a national climate change conversation in Scotland. The 
paper concludes with a reﬂection on the strengths and limits of using 
the Narrative Workshop methodology to build a broader social consensus 
on the need for ambitious climate change policies.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Energy and climate change research has been dominated by 
particular methods and approaches to deﬁning and addressing problems, 
accomplished by gathering and analysing the corresponding forms of 
evidence. This special issue starts from the broad concepts of stories, 
narratives, and storytelling to go beyond these analytic conventions, 
approaching the intersection of nature, humanity, and technology in 
multiple ways, using lenses from social sciences, humanities, and 
practitioners’ perspectives. The contributors use stories as data 
objects to gather, analyse, and critique; stories as an approach to 
research an inquiry; narrative analysis as a way of crystallising 
arguments and assumptions; and storytelling as a way of understanding, 
communicating, and inﬂuencing others. In using these forms of evidence 
and communication, and applying methods, analytical stances, and 
interpretations that these invite, something new and diﬀerent results. 
This essay is a brief introduction to how, in our view, stories and 
their kin ﬁt in energy and climate change research. We outline the 
diversity of data, approaches, and goals represented in the 
contributions to the special issue. And we reﬂect on some of the 
challenges of, and possibilities for, continuing to develop ‘stories’ as
 data sources, as modes of inquiry, and as creative paths toward social 
engagement.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article explores the value of Deleuzoguattarian 
approaches for understanding the entangled relationships between 
globalization, climate change, capitalism and indigenous peoples. 
Drawing on Brett Neilson’s concept of wild globalization, it analyzes 
the biopolitics of climate change and capitalism as they are experienced
 on Nicaragua’s Mosquito Coast. A focus on the heterogeneous economies 
and ecologies of the Miskito Keys and their destruction by Hurricane 
Felix reveals the destabilizing forces immanent to capitalism itself. 
Thinking about climate change not as a transcendent teleological 
megahazard, but as a Body without Organs, might enable us to be 
schizophrenic rather than paranoid about climate change.</td>
